# Java-bf
Java-bf is a Java-based interpreter for the Brainfuck programming language.

Included are ```mandelbrot.bf``` and ```hanoi.bf```, which are meant to be used as benchmarking programs for the interpreter.
```mandelbrot.bf``` was originally written by Erik Bosman, and ```hanoi.bf``` by Roland Illig.
Both were downloaded from Panu Kalliokoski's [Brainfuck archive](https://sange.fi/esoteric/brainfuck/).
